Update on v1.2:

Should not crash when Scanning barcodes with a list<5
Added optional camera scanning capability
Has start new file option when shared file.

Please also note that when new file is started via share button, app will not consider the items in the past csv to be part of the current.
Effectively meaning if you scan the item again, the app will not error with "repeated value"
